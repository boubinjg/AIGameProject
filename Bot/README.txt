This is everything you need to run Our Bot.

This program does not require command line arguments. 

This should properly compile in eclipse.
The transposition.txt file is read by the program as /src/bot/transposition.txt,
which works in eclipse because eclipse assumes your base directory is /src/

If this program will not be compiled and run in eclipse as the tournament moderator code
was, please let me know and I will make the appropriate adjustments. 

Thanks,
